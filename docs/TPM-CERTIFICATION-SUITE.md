# TPM Certification Suite

The TPM Certification Suite is the canonical quality and release-validation framework for TeknoParrot Manager.

## Mission

Certify builds—not just run tests.

A build is only eligible for release when all required certification gates pass.

## Certification Lanes

- Regression Suite
- Human-Use Simulation
- Real Install Validation
- Known Bug Regression
- Golden Normalization
- Adversarial Testing
- Mutation Testing
- Fuzz Testing
- Property Testing
- Chaos Testing
- Performance & Scale Testing
- Security & Static Analysis
- Release Certification
- Certification Scorecard

## Certification Levels

### Level 1 — Development Certified
Fast developer validation.

### Level 2 — Beta Certified
Adds human-use simulation and real-install validation.

### Level 3 — Release Candidate Certified
Adds adversarial, mutation, fuzz, performance, and security validation.

### Level 4 — Gold Certified
Full certification including long-duration, scale, and stress testing.

## Required Artifacts

Every certification run should produce:

- TPM-Certification-Scorecard.md
- TPM-Certification-Scorecard.json
- TPM-Validation-Report.md
- TPM-Validation-Report.json
- Install Health report
- Pester results
- Static analysis results
- Detailed logs
- Performance metrics
- Failure diagnostics

## Guiding Principle

Passing tests does not automatically certify a build. Certification requires all applicable quality gates to pass.
