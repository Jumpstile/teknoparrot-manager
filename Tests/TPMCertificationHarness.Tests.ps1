#Requires -Module Pester

# Regression coverage for scripts/Invoke-TPM-RealInstanceSmoke.ps1 -- the TPM
# Certification Suite's real-install harness. The harness script has
# top-level executable code (backup, Pester run, git status, etc.), so it
# cannot be dot-sourced directly without launching a full run against
# whatever -TeknoParrotRoot/-RepoPath happen to resolve to. Instead, this
# extracts just the reporting/scoring functions via AST, same technique
# Tests/TeknoParrot-Manager.Tests.ps1 uses for the main script.
#
# Why this file exists: New-CertificationScorecard shipped with an inline
# "Details=(if (...) {...} else {...})" hashtable-literal value. That is
# valid-looking PowerShell and passes Parser::ParseFile with zero errors --
# PowerShell parses hashtable-literal (@{...}) values in *command* mode, not
# *expression* mode, so a statement keyword like "if" (even parenthesized)
# only fails at actual execution: "The term 'if' is not recognized as a
# name of a cmdlet...". This crashed the harness on every real run, always
# after Pester and install-health collection had already completed and
# reported success -- exactly the kind of failure a parse-only gate cannot
# catch. Confirmed by direct reproduction before the fix landed.
#
# Run with: Invoke-Pester -Path .\Tests\TPMCertificationHarness.Tests.ps1
